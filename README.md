## Description
The shape map datasets used by this project are ultimately sourced from the open-source [Digital Boundary Files](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files) datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statics (ABS).
The datasets have then been processed into ToPoJSON files and these files can be found in my other project [Australian Spatial Data](https://github.com/sherwinzxw/australian-spatial-data/tree/master).
